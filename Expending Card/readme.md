## "overflow: hidden"

is a CSS property that is used to hide the content that overflows the container element. When you apply "overflow: hidden" to an element, it clips any content that exceeds the dimensions of the container and hides it from view.

This property is commonly used when you have a container with a fixed height or width, and the content inside the container exceeds the dimensions of the container. By applying "overflow: hidden" to the container, you can hide the overflowing content, which can help to improve the layout and prevent any layout issues.

Note that "overflow: hidden" can also affect the behavior of scrollbars. If the content inside the container is too large to fit, "overflow: hidden" will prevent the scrollbars from appearing, and the content will remain hidden.

## "flex: 0.5"

is a shorthand property in CSS that sets the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties of a flex item.

The flex-grow property specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to the other flex items in the same flex container. The default value is 0, which means the item will not grow. If you set flex-grow to a positive number, the item will grow and take up more space in the container. The higher the number, the more the item will grow relative to other flex items in the container.

The flex-shrink property specifies how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other flex items in the container. The default value is 1, which means the item will shrink if necessary. If you set flex-shrink to a positive number, the item will shrink less than other flex items with lower flex-shrink values.

In the case of "flex: 0.5", it sets both flex-grow and flex-shrink to 0.5, which means the item will grow and shrink with half the rate of other flex items with the default value of 1. This can be useful when you want a flex item to take up some space in the container, but not too much or too little.

## "classList"

is a read-only property of an HTML element's DOM object, which returns a live collection of the class attributes of the element. It provides a way to access and manipulate the classes of an element without directly manipulating the element's "class" attribute.

The "classList" property is an instance of the "DOMTokenList" interface, which contains a set of methods for adding, removing, toggling, and checking for the presence of classes. The methods are as follows:

- "add(className)": Adds the specified class to the element's class list.
- "remove(className)": Removes the specified class from the element's class list.
- "toggle(className)": Toggles the specified class. If the class exists, it is removed; if it does not exist, it is added.
- "contains(className)": Returns a Boolean indicating whether the element has the specified class.

Using "classList" to manipulate the classes of an element is often preferred over directly manipulating the "class" attribute, as it provides a cleaner and more flexible way to manage classes. For example, you can easily add or remove multiple classes at once using the "add" and "remove" methods, or you can toggle a class based on a condition using the "toggle" method.
